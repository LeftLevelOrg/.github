DROP-IN INSTALL (Organization Profile)

1) Create (or open) the special org repo:
   https://github.com/LeftLevelOrg/.github

2) Upload these files into EXACT path:
   .github/profile/README.md
   .github/profile/LeftLevel_Banner_Solid.svg
   .github/profile/LeftLevel_Banner_Transparent.svg
   .github/profile/README_SETUP.txt

3) Commit the changes. Make sure the .github repo is PUBLIC:
   Settings → Danger Zone → Change repository visibility → Public

4) Refresh your org page:
   https://github.com/LeftLevelOrg

Notes:
- The README uses <picture> to auto-switch banners for dark/light mode.
- If the banner doesn't appear immediately, wait ~30s and hard refresh.
- If you rename the org or branch, update the raw URLs in README.md accordingly.
